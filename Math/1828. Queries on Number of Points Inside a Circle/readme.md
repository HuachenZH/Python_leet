You are given an array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] is the coordinates of the ith point on a 2D plane. Multiple points can have the same coordinates.

You are also given an array queries where queries[j] = [xj, yj, rj] describes a circle centered at (xj, yj) with a radius of rj.

For each query queries[j], compute the number of points inside the jth circle. Points on the border of the circle are considered inside.

Return an array answer, where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.


Constraints:

1 <= points.length <= 500
points[i].length == 2
0 <= x​​​​​​i, y​​​​​​i <= 500
1 <= queries.length <= 500
queries[j].length == 3
0 <= xj, yj <= 500
1 <= rj <= 500
All coordinates are integers.
